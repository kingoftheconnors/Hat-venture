Backlog:
* SPEEN
* Skidding opposite bash direction glitch (cannot isolate?)
* SFX!
* Brewing cap charging?
* Hard Hat passive ability
* Celeste-level platformer-mercy:
    Bashing into a wall will check if it could slide up or down to ease around block
    Jumping into ceiling will check if it could slide left or right to ease around block

Waiting on Ang:
*Super dash animation
*Small animation signal each combo rocker
-Brew bottle explosion
* De-equip animation
* Pons GUI
* Score sources and uses
