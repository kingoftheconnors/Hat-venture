Fixed some closing-game-errors


This sprint:
* Walk left breaking block error



Backlog:
*Super dash animation
*Stun time after bashing (if no combo)
*Small animation signal each combo rocker
-Brew bottle explosion
* SPEEN

* Pons
* Max Health changes?
* Score sources and uses
* Skidding opposite bash direction glitch (cannot isolate?)
* SFX!
* De-equip animation
* Brewing cap charging?
* Hard Hat passive ability
* Ease of tileset use
* Celeste-level platformer-mercy:
    Bashing into a wall will check if it could slide up or down to ease around block
    Jumping into ceiling will check if it could slide left or right to ease around block
