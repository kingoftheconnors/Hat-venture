Level Clear Time

-- Misc
The music start and loop parts for the grass world seem to have a small gap in between? Is there any way to fix that?
Interrupting jump with getting hurt so that the freefall animation interrupts hurt's pause function which causes game to be paused forever?
Interrupting dive with getting hurt causes being locked in no-jump-mode
Angus' 
Level transition during pause causes frozen game


Backlog:
* Score Multiplicity (no-touch-ground-combos, allowing to dive into blocks from side to jump upwards which would keep combo going, getting done with time left on timer, etc)
* Different worlds with different color schemes
* Always introduce new mechanics/enemies in subsequent levels
* Side tracks and secrets (pipes, areas under blocks, etc)
* Level Select
* Hard Hat passive ability
Input needed:
* Thor Hat Spinning
* Checkpoints
* Score sources and uses
* SFX!
* Checkpoints
