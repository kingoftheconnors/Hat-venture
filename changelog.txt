Powers:
Hat Kid throwing animation is now .2 seconds long

* Hat Kid throwing
* Shoulder bash
* SPEEN
** Hat Kid's main gimmick feels wonky on the ground compared to how it looks and works in AHiT. Should have more air to the dash, should have the ability to get a speed boost if jump button is pressed at the right time, and should slide on the ground just a bit without picking oneself up.
* Sprint should ramp up slower and the animation should reflect the speed.
* Block breaking
