* Similarly, death by falling into a hole shouldn't play the death animation, and should just have the music.
* * Game Over text should be how it is in the mockups
* Thor's Cap should have a bit more vertical and/or horizontal reach to it. It feels rather lackluster as it is ATM meaning it becomes difficult to reach anything with its ability.
* Speaking of, I think it that the grounded version should just have a spin with the FX for more damage-focused ability, saving the aerial for maneuverability.
* Also add the FX to the move so they can actually hit things lol

Slow spinning deceleration (when in air)
Spinning hitting blocks too soon

That Eltun

Backlog:
