0.1.3
Move skid animation 8 pixels off
Pon animation effect
Powers deactivate when you lose them due to health loss
Made player colliders square, so blocks cannot be slid down
Add Thor Power
Add Hard Hat Power
Cleaned up local files for ease of use

Powers:
Hat Kid throwing animation is now .2 seconds long
Hat Kid throwing bottles
Should bash
Slowed acceleration for all walking
Sprint animation speeds up to reflect speed


This sprint:
* Block breaking animation
* SPEEN
* Contact frienda about music?
** Hat Kid's main gimmick feels wonky on the ground compared to how it looks and works in AHiT. Should have more air to the dash, should have the ability to get a speed boost if jump button is pressed at the right time, and should slide on the ground just a bit without picking oneself up.

Backlog:
* SFX!
* De-equip animation
* Bottle explosion
* Hard Hat passive ability
* Brewing cap charging?
* Enemies
* Ease of tileset use
* Power recharge timer
