Backlog:
Discuss level design with QP:
    Start out FORGIVING. By end of New Game+, you will be dealing with more difficult versions of the same levels, so start easy, get hard
    Game will start out with tutorial section (Hat Kid's Spaceship), so we don't need too much tutorialization
    New Game+ allows configuring the default hat power, so all levels should be winnable with any hat
    For underground levels, the absolute minimum level height is 240 (one screen size), so you can make a tight cavern at that height
Add more bottom-area saves to level 1-2 (missing one jump and fulling straight down without any rescue ledges is too painful)
    Tilesets also can instance objects. Pons, Springs, and ladders are all placeable using tilesets

Keep power between levels

Dialog progression system: A forces to end of 2-lines, or moves to next two lines if already there. B skips text box

Fix enemy animations causing levels to be re-saved (Vanill: moving param, Poddle isTurning and enemy "frame" variables)

Sprint quieter than most sfx (put in BackgroundSfx)
Sprint sfx keep pitch-up even after small interruptions (as BackgroundSfx, only stops when StopBackgroundsound is called when Run is stopped)

Glitch: Eltun flypath respawning (reset goal path piece)
Poddle-allow crouching to dodge bullets (doublecheck with Brawlitup)
Music:
   Spaceship Music
   Timmy Strikes! Music
   Grassland Music
   Boss 1 Music
   Skid sfx
   Block-break sfx
Art:
   Checkpoint flag
   Ladder-climbing (other powers)
   Boss 1
   Victory Dance animation
   Decide best way to resize HUD a.k.a Fix Mixling (when different pixel variants for HUD is used than for level)
