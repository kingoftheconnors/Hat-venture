# Hat-venture
A gameboy-inspired de-make of A Hat in Time. When the mysterious and "radical" overlord Timmy steals the Time Pieces--hourglasses that allow time
travel--it's up to Hat Kid to get them back! Use your wits, dive, and hats to explore the lands and get those Time Pieces back!

Dive back into the cute as heck platforming world of Hat Kid and her friends! This time in one less dimension with the style and charm of the original
Gameboy. Challenge yourself for the best times, and find all kinds of palettes for your 2-bit viewing pleasure!
